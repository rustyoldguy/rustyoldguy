- 👋 Hi, I’m @rustyoldguy
- 👀 I’m interested in quality control and statistical process control, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to convert my c programs for shell to QT for example DIN EN ISO 286 DIN 13-1 DIN ISO 965-2, wear limits of plug gauges, test instructions depending of lot size and Acceptable Quality Level,calculate values for gears like base circle root circle addendum circle, clearance,working with module series for spur wheels, calculate the distance of bores on different pitch circles, calculate triangles,calculate machine cabability index depending of tolerances and warning also action limits in connection with standard deviation and statistical process control.
     
Currently i am working as an temporary worker(production assistant with 10,46€ gross wage per hour).
II think I don't need to be ashamed of it. One of my colleagues in Germany studied philosophy and ancient Greek, with a bachelor's degree. Another colleague studied computer science in his home country Iraq with a master’s degree. For Information: I have about 90 Percent colleauges who are not Germans. They came from everywhere of Planet earth like Asia, Phillipines, Irak, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italia and God knows where from.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to make RPMs for my Programs
