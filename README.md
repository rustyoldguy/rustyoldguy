- 👋 Hi, I’m @rustyoldguy
- 👀 I’m interested in quality control and statistical process control, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to convert my c programs for shell to QT for example DIN EN ISO 286 DIN 13-1 DIN ISO 965-2, wear limits of plug gauges, test instructions
     depending of lot size and Acceptable Quality Level,calculate values for gears like base circle root circle addendum circle, clearance,working with module series
     for spur wheels, calculate the distance of bores on different pitch circles, calculate triangles,calculate machine cabability index depending of tolerance
     and warning also action limits in connection with standard deviation and statistical process control.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programs for quality assurance
